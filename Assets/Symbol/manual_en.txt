This template is for saving data on the Symbol blockchain.
It allows for basic tasks such as creating accounts, sending transactions, generating mosaics (tokens), and writing data.
You can also use this template for other applications.

The demo scene is available below, so please try playing around with it first.

There are two types of blockchains: a testnet for development and a mainnet for production.
The UseNetwork variable in SymbolGameManager.cs allows you to set whether to use the testnet or mainnet,
so please switch between them as appropriate.

The fauset site for XYM (Symbol's base currency) for the testnet is below, so please download it and use it for development.

The address to send fees when saving data to a mosaic is defined in the ReceiveAccount parameter in SymbolGameManager.cs.
Please modify it as necessary.
